# How to use

1. Install the script `install-script.sh` from the [releases](https://github.com/LuuppiZ/opinsys-install-script/releases/tag/Release) tab
2. Go to the directory where the script is located. Likely the downloads folder
3. Open terminal by right clicking in the file explorer and pressing "Open in terminal"
4. Run this `bash install-script.sh`

- All of these automatically uninstall on reboot except Steam although all user data is still kept.
