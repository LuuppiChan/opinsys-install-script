# PATCHED!!!
THIS HAS BEEN PATCHED FOR NOW.

They took away sudo access which completely breaks this method. You could still maybe use user Flatpak to install some applications.

# How to use

1. Install the script `install-script.sh` from the [releases](https://github.com/LuuppiZ/opinsys-install-script/releases/tag/Release) tab
2. Go to the directory where the script is located. Likely the downloads folder
3. Open terminal by right clicking in the file explorer and pressing "Open in terminal"
4. Run this `bash install-script.sh`
5. Done! install/uninstall/launch the wanted programs.

- All of these automatically uninstall on reboot except Steam although all user data is still kept.
